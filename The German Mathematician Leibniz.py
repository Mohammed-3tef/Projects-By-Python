# Program: The German mathematician Leibniz (1646â€“1716) discovered the rather remarkable fact that
#           the mathematical constant PI can be computed.
#           The formula represents an infinite series; each fraction represents a term in that series.
#           If you start with 1, subtract one-third, add one-fifth, and so on, for each of the odd integers, you
#           get a number that gets closer and closer to the value of PI/4 as you go along. Then we can get PI.
